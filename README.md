# Nvim / Neovide Game Dev Config, heavily inspired by ThePrimeagen.

Overarching is to make a config that fits Game Development like a shrek fits his swamp.

*Prerequisite requirements:*

- Make sure you install the clangd support component through Visual Studio Setup, and make sure the installed clang++.exe is in your system path env variable. Needs to be added manually to path, the installer does not do that
- Python 3.11 - 3.12 installed in your path
- From cmd line do pip install neovim to install the python neovim module. Needed for ultisnips snippets
- Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and ensure to add ripgrep in your path.
